An image well for the user to drag-and-drop an image to. 

The image control gives stack developers a way to maintain complete control over an image. The user cannot scale/rotate the images in an image control like they can with images dropped into edit mode. 

Image controls are designed to be used in conjunction with [Image Transforms](../imageTransform/). Image transforms allow the developer to scale, rotate, and add styles to an image -- all of the same adjustments the user can perform from inside the Stack image editing mode.
