Static informational text. 

The Title is the only part of this control that is displayed.

Usually keeping controls to a minimum and using descriptive titles and tooltips is enough to make the use of your stack obvious. Occasionally there's a need for a bit more text. If you find you need this control often, it's a sign that your stack is too confusing. 

**Never explain something confusing. Just make it less confusing.**

*Please use this sparingly.*
